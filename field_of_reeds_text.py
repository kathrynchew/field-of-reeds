    \nYou are raised in a respectable house for a respectable life of government service. You learn to read and write (a privilege reserved for only a few), learn a bit about politics, and study some of history's great literature.
    \nTragically, upon the death of your father, you learn that he has many debts--gambling debts. After the great expense of your father's funeral entourage, you must sell the rest of the family property to pay off what he owes. You are left penniless. 
    \nYou strike out on your own, trying to make your own way and to hopefully earn a few deben of wealth to call your own.
    \n\nIt's a tough world out there. May you have the blessings of life, prosperity, and health!\n\n\n""",

You don't know why, but you begin questioning every choice you have ever made. You think of your father and how he ended up the way he did...ruining your family over a few selfish decisions.
    \nYou feel a little claustrophobic. You fumble in the dark for your oil lamp and light it with an ember from the dying hearth. You take the lamp outside with you and down to the shore of the river, where the breeze is always fresh. If you could just get a little air, maybe you could clear your head.
    \nUpon reaching the shore you take a few deep breaths, and even wade into the reeds a little bit, the water cool and comforting on your skin. You reach down to the water to splash a little on your face.
    \n\n...
    \n\nYou'll never know if it was the bright flicker of your lamp, or the splashing of your fingers in the water that attracted the crocodile. By the time you realize there is a crocodile at all, it is too late.\n\n\n""",
        "judgement_scene_1": """\nA voice booms out, 'Awake! Awake, {player_name}, and be judged!'
    \nThe voice is deep and chilling. You cannot help but obey.
    \nYou struggle to open your eyes. Your vision seems to swim before you. At first, everything is blackness, but in a moment the blur of your eyes focuses sharply into a vision you never truly thought you would see.
    \nYour eyes light first on a giant pair of golden scales in the center of a vast room. Behind it, glowing like the brightest moon, is the face of--could it really be? Osiris, the king of the dead! And before his massive throne, Thoth, the god of wisdom!
    \nBefore you can fully register what you are seeing, a closer, darker figure beckons to get your attention. It is the jackal-headed Anubis, midwife of dead souls, the god who shepherds all deceased to the afterlife, or at least...to their judgement day.
    \nAnubis reaches towards you, his hand grasping. You want to recoil from him, but you find you cannot move. In a flash of pain, his divine hand enters your chest cavity, grasps your heart, and pulls it, separating it from your flesh.
    \nGingerly, Anubis places your once-throbbing heart onto one side of the scales. Your mind, blank with fear, remembers in a panic that your heart will be weighed down by your sins and transgressions committed in life. And in order to be allowed to proceed to the Field of Reeds, the glorious afterlife, your sins must weigh no more than a feather--the Feather of Truth, the Feather of Ma'at.
    \nSeeming to sense your thoughts, Anubis nods. With one hand he gestures towards Thoth, who carries a glowing white feather, the Feather of Ma'at itself. With the other hand he gestures into the darkness below you. All at once you hear a low rumbling growl. It is only then that you see her--Ammut, the Devourer. Part hippo, part lion, and part crocodile, in her jaws lay the fate of all those poor souls judged unworthy by the golden scales. In her jaws lay the void of oblivion.
    \n\n""",
